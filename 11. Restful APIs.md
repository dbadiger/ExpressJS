# RESTful APIs with ExpressJS
A RESTful API is a web service that follows REST principles, using HTTP methods to perform actions on resources.

## REST API Principles
#### 1. Stateless
- Every request from the client must contain all the necessary information.
#### 2. Client-Server Architecture
- The frontend and backend communicate via a well-defined API.
#### 3. Resource-Based
- Everything is treated as a resource (eg. users, products, orders), each with a unique URL.
#### 4. HTTP Methods for CRUD Operations

- GET - Read/Display Data - /api/product/list
- PUT - Create/Insert Data - /api/product/add
- PUT - Update Data - /api/product/update
- PUT replaces the entire resource with new data,
- while PATCH applies partial updates to specific fields within an existing resource
- DELETE - Remove Data - /api/product/del/:id

#### PUT:
- Replaces the entire resource with the data provided in the request body.
- If the resource doesn't exist, PUT creates it.
- Is considered idempotent, meaning multiple identical requests have the same effect as a single request.

#### PATCH:
- Applies partial updates to a resource, modifying only the specified fields.
- Does not require sending the entire resource data.
- Is not always idempotent, as repeated requests might not always result in the same state, especially if the resource has auto-incrementing fields.
const express = require('express');
const app = express();
const port = 3000;

      app.use(express.json());
      // Define a route for PATCH requests (Partial update)
      app.patch('/users/:id', (req, res) => {
          const userId = req.params.id;
          const partialUpdate = req.body;
          res.json({ message: `User with ID ${userId} updated`, updatedUser });
      
      });
      // Start the server
      app.listen(port, () => {
          console.log(`Server is running on http://localhost:${port}`);
      });

  
### Use proper HTTP Status Codes
Each type of code belongs to a particular class, which conveys the type of response.
##### 2xx (success): These codes indicate that the request was successfully processed by the server.
- 200 OK: The request was successful, and the server has sent back the requested data (for GET requests)
- 201 Created: The resource was successfully created (for POST requests)
- 204 No Content: The request was succesful, but there's no data to return (commonly used for DELET or PUT requests)

##### 4xx (Client Errors): These codes indicate that there was an issue with client's request, meaning the client needs to fix something.
- 400 Bad Request: The server cannot process the request due to bad syntax.
- 401 Unauthorized: The request lacks valid authentication credentials.
- 403 Forbidden: The server understood the request, but it refuses to authorize it.
- 404 Not Found: The requested resource was not found on the server.
- 422 Unprocessable Entity: The server understans the content type and syntax, but request cannot be processed (often used in validation errors).

 ##### 5xx (Server Errors): These codes indicate that the server has failed to fulfill a vaild request.
 - 500 Internal Server Error: A generic error message when the server encounters an unexcepted condition.
 - 502 Bad Gateway: The server received an invalid response from an upstream server.
 - 503 Service Unavailable: The server is currently unavailable (eg. due to being overloaded or down for maintenance)

   ## Why Status codes Matter:
   - Clarity: They give the client or user a clear indication of what happened with the request.
   - Error Handling: They allow the client to properly habdle different kinds of errors (eg
