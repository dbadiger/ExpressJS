# RESTful APIs with ExpressJS
A RESTful API is a web service that follows REST principles, using HTTP methods to perform actions on resources.

## REST API Principles
#### 1. Stateless
- Every request from the client must contain all the necessary information.
#### 2. Client-Server Architecture
- The frontend and backend communicate via a well-defined API.
#### 3. Resource-Based
- Everything is treated as a resource (eg. users, products, orders), each with a unique URL.
#### 4. HTTP Methods for CRUD Operations

- GET - Read/Display Data - /api/product/list
- PUT - Create/Insert Data - /api/product/add
- PUT - Update Data - /api/product/update
- PUT replaces the entire resource with new data,
- while PATCH applies partial updates to specific fields within an existing resource
- DELETE - Remove Data - /api/product/del/:id

#### PUT:
- Replaces the entire resource with the data provided in the request body.
- If the resource doesn't exist, PUT creates it.
- Is considered idempotent, meaning multiple identical requests have the same effect as a single request.

#### PATCH:
- Applies partial updates to a resource, modifying only the specified fields.
- Does not require sending the entire resource data.
- Is not always idempotent, as repeated requests might not always result in the same state, especially if the resource has auto-incrementing fields.
const express = require('express');
const app = express();
const port = 3000;

      app.use(express.json());
      // Define a route for PATCH requests (Partial update)
      app.patch('/users/:id', (req, res) => {
          const userId = req.params.id;
          const partialUpdate = req.body;
          res.json({ message: `User with ID ${userId} updated`, updatedUser });
      
      });
      // Start the server
      app.listen(port, () => {
          console.log(`Server is running on http://localhost:${port}`);
      });

  
## Use proper HTTP Status Codes
Each type of code belongs to a particular class, which conveys the type of response.
##### 2xx (success): These codes indicate that the request was successfully processed by the server.
- 200 OK: The request was successful, and the server has sent back the requested data (for GET requests)
- 201 Created: The resource was successfully created (for POST requests)
- 204 No Content: The request was successful, but there's no data to return (commonly used for DELETE or PUT requests)

##### 4xx (Client Errors): These codes indicate that there was an issue with the client's request, meaning the client needs to fix something.
- 400 Bad Request: The server cannot process the request due to bad syntax.
- 401 Unauthorized: The request lacks valid authentication credentials.
- 403 Forbidden: The server understood the request, but it refuses to authorize it.
- 404 Not Found: The requested resource was not found on the server.
- 422 Unprocessable Entity: The server understands the content type and syntax, but the request cannot be processed (often used in validation errors).

 ##### 5xx (Server Errors): These codes indicate that the server has failed to fulfill a vaild request.
 - 500 Internal Server Error: A generic error message when the server encounters an unexcepted condition.
 - 502 Bad Gateway: The server received an invalid response from an upstream server.
 - 503 Service Unavailable: The server is currently unavailable (eg. due to being overloaded or down for maintenance)

### Why Status codes Matter:
- Clarity: They give the client or user a clear indication of what happened with the request.
- Error Handling: They allow the client to properly handle different kinds of errors (eg, retrying the request or notifying the user).
- Standardization: they provide a consistent way to communicate results across different APIs, making it easier for developers to work with APIs.

In short, status codes are necessary to help the client understand the outcome of the request and to handle any issus accordingly.

 //Get All Products
 
      app.get('/api/products',(req, res)=>{
            const products = [
            {id:1, name:'laptop', price:20120},
            {id:2, name:'mobile', price:1011}
            ]
            res.status(200).json({products})
      })

//Get Single Product

      app.get('/api/products/:id', (req, res)=>{
            const products = [
                  {id:1, name:'laptop', price:20120},
                  {id:2, name:'mobile', price:1011}
                  ]
                  const product=products.find(p=>p.id === Number(req.params.id))
                  if(!product){
                  return res.status(400).json({message:'Product Not Found!'})
                  }
                  res.status(200).json(product)
      })
//Create new Product

      app.post('/api/products',(req, res)=>{
            const newProduct=Date.now()
            res.status(201).json(newProduct)
      })
