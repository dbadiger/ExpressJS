# Authentication in ExpressJS:
Auntentication is the process of verifying the identity of an user. In ExpressJS, authentication ensures that only authorized users can access certain resorces.

### Implementing User Authentication in Express
There are two main ways to implement authentication in an ExpressJS application:

1. Aession-Based Authentication (Uses cookies and sessions)
2. Tokens-Based Authentication (Uses JWT or 0Auth/OAuth tokens)

#### Basic authentication flows:
1. The user sends login credentials(email/password)
2. The server verifies the credentials against a database.
3. If valid, the server responds with a session(cookie) or a JWT token.
4. The client stores this session or token for subsequent requests.
5. For each request, the client sends the session/token for verification.
