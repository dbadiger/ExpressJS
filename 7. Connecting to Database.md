# Connecting to Database (MongoDB and Mongoose)

MongoDB - MongoDB is popular, open-source, NoSQL database that stores data in a flexible, JSON-like format called BSON (Binary JSON).
- Document Oriented
- High Performance
- Flexible Schema

Mongoose is an Object Data Modeling (ODM) library for MongoDB and NodeJS. It makes easier to interact with and manipulate MongoDB documents in a more structured way.
- Schema-Based: We can pre-defined schema and using that we can store our document and we can apply multiple methods.
- Validation: We add multiple validations for each of our properties. We can use pre-defined validations like `required`, `min max`, `length`, or we can also create our own custom validation method.
- Middleware: If we want to store any document and before storing the document wehave to process on the data, this we can easily perform using middleware.
- Built-In Methods: We have many built-in Methods to perform the data creation, deletion, and updation tasks.
